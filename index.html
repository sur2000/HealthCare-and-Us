        <h3>The first wealth is health</h3>
        <p>According to WHO, Healthy living is a way of living that helps you enjoy more 
            aspects of your life. It is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously 
            ill or dying early. Health is not just about avoiding a disease or illness. It is about physical, mental and social well-being too.</p>
